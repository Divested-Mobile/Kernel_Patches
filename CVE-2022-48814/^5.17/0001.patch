Subject: net: dsa: seville: register the mdiobus under devres

As explained in commits:
74b6d7d13307 ("net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres")
5135e96a3dd2 ("net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres")

mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-
devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was
not previously unregistered.

The Seville VSC9959 switch is a platform device, so the initial set of
constraints that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call
->remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which
applies here.

If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown
(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link
between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()
will unbind the seville switch driver on shutdown.

So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which
is: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,
or don't use devres at all.

The seville driver has a code structure that could accommodate both the
mdiobus_unregister and mdiobus_free calls, but it has an external
dependency upon mscc_miim_setup() from mdio-mscc-miim.c, which calls
devm_mdiobus_alloc_size() on its behalf. So rather than restructuring
that, and exporting yet one more symbol mscc_miim_teardown(), let's work
with devres and replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant.
When we use all-devres, we can ensure that devres doesn't free a
still-registered bus (it either runs both callbacks, or none).

Fixes: ac3a68d56651 ("net: phy: don't abuse devres in devm_mdiobus_register()")
