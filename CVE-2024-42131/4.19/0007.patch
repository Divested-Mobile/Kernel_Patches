Subject: mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic

[ Upstream commit 385d838df280eba6c8680f9777bfa0d0bfe7e8b2 ]

The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty
limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications
fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,
possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so
large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For
dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty
limits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result to
exceed UINT_MAX.

This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator
sets dirty limits to >16 TB.
