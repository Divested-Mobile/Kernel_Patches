Subject: mm, thp: make do_huge_pmd_wp_page() lock page for testing mapcount

Jann reported [1] a race between __split_huge_pmd_locked() and
page_trans_huge_map_swapcount() which can result in a page to be reused
instead of COWed. This was later assigned CVE-2020-29368.

This was fixed by commit c444eb564fb1 ("mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic
against __split_huge_pmd_locked()") by doing the split under the page lock,
while all users of page_trans_huge_map_swapcount() were already also under page
lock. The fix was backported also to 4.9 stable series.

When testing the backport on a 4.12 based kernel, Nicolai noticed the POC from
[1] still reproduces after backporting c444eb564fb1 and identified a missing
page lock in do_huge_pmd_wp_page() around the call to
page_trans_huge_mapcount(). The page lock was only added in ba3c4ce6def4 ("mm,
THP, swap: make reuse_swap_page() works for THP swapped out") in 4.14. The
commit also wrapped page_trans_huge_mapcount() into
page_trans_huge_map_swapcount() for the purposes of COW decisions.

I have verified that 4.9.y indeed also reproduces with the POC. Backporting
ba3c4ce6def4 alone however is not possible as it's part of a larger effort of
optimizing THP swapping, which would be risky to backport fully.

Therefore this 4.9-stable-only patch just wraps page_trans_huge_mapcount()
in page_trans_huge_mapcount() under page lock the same way as ba3c4ce6def4
does, but without the page_trans_huge_map_swapcount() part. Other callers
of page_trans_huge_mapcount() are all under page lock already. I have verified
the POC no longer reproduces afterwards.
