Subject: x86/speculation/l1tf: Drop the swap storage limit restriction when
 l1tf=off

commit 5b5e4d623ec8a34689df98e42d038a3b594d2ff9 upstream.

Swap storage is restricted to max_swapfile_size (~16TB on x86_64) whenever
the system is deemed affected by L1TF vulnerability. Even though the limit
is quite high for most deployments it seems to be too restrictive for
deployments which are willing to live with the mitigation disabled.

We have a customer to deploy 8x 6,4TB PCIe/NVMe SSD swap devices which is
clearly out of the limit.

Drop the swap restriction when l1tf=off is specified. It also doesn't make
much sense to warn about too much memory for the l1tf mitigation when it is
forcefully disabled by the administrator.

[ tglx: Folded the documentation delta change ]
