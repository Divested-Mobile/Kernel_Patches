Subject: media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc_ca_pmt()

commit 35d2969ea3c7d32aee78066b1f3cf61a0d935a4e upstream.

The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should
be checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes.  If the
"es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
be an additional check for that.

I also added checks for the "write_pos".  I don't think these are
required because "read_pos" and "write_pos" are tied together so
checking one ought to be enough.  But they make the code easier to
understand for me.  The check on write_pos is:

	if (write_pos + 4 >= sizeof(c->operand) - 4) {

The first "+ 4" is because we're writing 5 bytes and the last " - 4"
is to leave space for the CRC.

The other problem is that "length" can be invalid.  It comes from
"data_length" in fdtv_ca_pmt().
