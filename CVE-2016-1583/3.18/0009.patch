Subject: ecryptfs: don't allow mmap when the lower fs doesn't support it

[ Upstream commit f0fe970df3838c202ef6c07a4c2b36838ef0a88b ]

There are legitimate reasons to disallow mmap on certain files, notably
in sysfs or procfs.  We shouldn't emulate mmap support on file systems
that don't offer support natively.

CVE-2016-1583
