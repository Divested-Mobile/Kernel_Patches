Subject: floppy: fix div-by-zero in setup_format_params

[ Upstream commit f3554aeb991214cbfafd17d55e2bfddb50282e32 ]

This fixes a divide by zero error in the setup_format_params function of
the floppy driver.

Two consecutive ioctls can trigger the bug: The first one should set the
drive geometry with such .sect and .rate values for the F_SECT_PER_TRACK
to become zero.  Next, the floppy format operation should be called.

A floppy disk is not required to be inserted.  An unprivileged user
could trigger the bug if the device is accessible.

The patch checks F_SECT_PER_TRACK for a non-zero value in the
set_geometry function.  The proper check should involve a reasonable
upper limit for the .sect and .rate fields, but it could change the
UAPI.

The patch also checks F_SECT_PER_TRACK in the setup_format_params, and
cancels the formatting operation in case of zero.

The bug was found by syzkaller.
