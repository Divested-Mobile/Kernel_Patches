Subject: Reinstate some of "swiotlb: rework "fix info leak with
 DMA_FROM_DEVICE""
MIME-Version: 1.0

commit 901c7280ca0d5e2b4a8929fbe0bfb007ac2a6544 upstream.

Halil Pasic points out [1] that the full revert of that commit (revert
in bddac7c1e02b), and that a partial revert that only reverts the
problematic case, but still keeps some of the cleanups is probably
better.  ￼

And that partial revert [2] had already been verified by Oleksandr
Natalenko to also fix the issue, I had just missed that in the long
discussion.

So let's reinstate the cleanups from commit aa6f8dcbab47 ("swiotlb:
rework "fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""), and effectively only
revert the part that caused problems.

-DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED
--------------------
-
-Some advanced peripherals such as remote processors and GPUs perform
-accesses to DMA buffers in both privileged "supervisor" and unprivileged
-"user" modes.  This attribute is used to indicate to the DMA-mapping
-subsystem that the buffer is fully accessible at the elevated privilege
-level (and ideally inaccessible or at least read-only at the
-lesser-privileged levels).
