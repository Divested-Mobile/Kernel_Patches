Subject: memcg: fix possible use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()

commit 4a7ba45b1a435e7097ca0f79a847d0949d0eb088 upstream.

memcg_write_event_control() accesses the dentry->d_name of the specified
control fd to route the write call.  As a cgroup interface file can't be
renamed, it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a
regular cgroup file.  Also, as these cgroup interface files can't be
removed before the directory, it's safe to access the parent too.

Prior to 347c4a874710 ("memcg: remove cgroup_event->cft"), there was a
call to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular
cgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from
__file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped
the file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the
invarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against
renames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.

Fix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().  Now that
cgroupfs is implemented through kernfs, checking the file operations needs
to go through a layer of indirection.  Instead, let's check the superblock
and dentry type.
