Subject: packet: in packet_do_bind, test fanout with bind_lock held

commit 4971613c1639d8e5f102c4e797c3bf8f83a5a69e upstream.

Once a socket has po->fanout set, it remains a member of the group
until it is destroyed. The prot_hook must be constant and identical
across sockets in the group.

If fanout_add races with packet_do_bind between the test of po->fanout
and taking the lock, the bind call may make type or dev inconsistent
with that of the fanout group.

Hold po->bind_lock when testing po->fanout to avoid this race.

I had to introduce artificial delay (local_bh_enable) to actually
observe the race.
