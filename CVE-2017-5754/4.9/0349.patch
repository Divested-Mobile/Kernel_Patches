Subject: kaiser: KAISER depends on SMP

It is absurd that KAISER should depend on SMP, but apparently nobody
has tried a UP build before: which breaks on implicit declaration of
function 'per_cpu_offset' in arch/x86/mm/kaiser.c.

Now, you would expect that to be trivially fixed up; but looking at
the System.map when that block is #ifdef'ed out of kaiser_init(),
I see that in a UP build __per_cpu_user_mapped_end is precisely at
__per_cpu_user_mapped_start, and the items carefully gathered into
that section for user-mapping on SMP, dispersed elsewhere on UP.

So, some other kind of section assignment will be needed on UP,
but implementing that is not a priority: just make KAISER depend
on SMP for now.

Also inserted a blank line before the option, tidied up the
brief Kconfig help message, and added an "If unsure, Y".
