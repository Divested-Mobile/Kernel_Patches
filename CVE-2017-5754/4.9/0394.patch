Subject: x86/pti: Make unpoison of pgd for trusted boot work for real

commit 445b69e3b75e42362a5bdc13c8b8f61599e2228a upstream

The inital fix for trusted boot and PTI potentially misses the pgd clearing
if pud_alloc() sets a PGD.  It probably works in *practice* because for two
adjacent calls to map_tboot_page() that share a PGD entry, the first will
clear NX, *then* allocate and set the PGD (without NX clear).  The second
call will *not* allocate but will clear the NX bit.

Defer the NX clearing to a point after it is known that all top-level
allocations have occurred.  Add a comment to clarify why.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog ]

[ hughd notes: I have not tested tboot, but this looks to me as necessary
and as safe in old-Kaiser backports as it is upstream; I'm not submitting
the commit-to-be-fixed 262b6b30087, since it was undone by 445b69e3b75e,
and makes conflict trouble because of 5-level's p4d versus 4-level's pgd.]
