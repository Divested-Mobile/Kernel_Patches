Subject: kaiser: asm/tlbflush.h handle noPGE at lower level

I found asm/tlbflush.h too twisty, and think it safer not to avoid
__native_flush_tlb_global_irq_disabled() in the kaiser_enabled case,
but instead let it handle kaiser_enabled along with cr3: it can just
use __native_flush_tlb() for that, no harm in re-disabling preemption.

(This is not the same change as Kirill and Dave have suggested for
upstream, flipping PGE in cr4: that's neat, but needs a cpu_has_pge
check; cr3 is enough for kaiser, and thought to be cheaper than cr4.)

Also delete the X86_FEATURE_INVPCID invpcid_flush_all_nonglobals()
preference from __native_flush_tlb(): unlike the invpcid_flush_all()
preference in __native_flush_tlb_global(), it's not seen in upstream
4.14, and was recently reported to be surprisingly slow.
