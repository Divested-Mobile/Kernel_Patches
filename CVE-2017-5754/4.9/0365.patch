Subject: kaiser: kaiser_remove_mapping() move along the pgd

When removing the bogus comment from kaiser_remove_mapping(),
I really ought to have checked the extent of its bogosity: as
Neel points out, there is nothing to stop unmap_pud_range_nofree()
from continuing beyond the end of a pud (and starting in the wrong
position on the next).

Fix kaiser_remove_mapping() to constrain the extent and advance pgd
pointer correctly: use pgd_addr_end() macro as used throughout base
mm (but don't assume page-rounded start and size in this case).

But this bug was very unlikely to trigger in this backport: since
any buddy allocation is contained within a single pud extent, and
we are not using vmapped stacks (and are only mapping one page of
stack anyway): the only way to hit this bug here would be when
freeing a large modified ldt.
