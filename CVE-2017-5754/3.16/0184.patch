Subject: x86: fix build warnign with 32-bit PAE

I ran into a 4.9 build warning in randconfig testing, starting with the
KAISER patches:

arch/x86/kernel/ldt.c: In function 'alloc_ldt_struct':
arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable_types.h:208:24: error: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Werror=overflow]
 #define __PAGE_KERNEL  (__PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC | _PAGE_NX)
                        ^
arch/x86/kernel/ldt.c:81:6: note: in expansion of macro '__PAGE_KERNEL'
      __PAGE_KERNEL);
      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

I originally ran into this last year when the patches were part of linux-next,
and tried to work around it by using the proper 'pteval_t' types consistently,
but that caused additional problems.

This takes a much simpler approach, and makes the argument type of the dummy
helper always 64-bit, which is wide enough for any page table layout and
won't hurt since this call is just an empty stub anyway.
