Subject: pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number

[ Upstream commit d49270a04623ce3c0afddbf3e984cb245aa48e9c ]

When the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers,
the zone size will become an odd number.
The address of the zone will become:
    addr of zone0 = BASE
    addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size
    addr of zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2
    ...
The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignment va.
Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va.

So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is even
to avoid this bug.
