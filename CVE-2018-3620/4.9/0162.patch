Subject: x86/speculation/l1tf: Extend 64bit swap file size limit

commit 1a7ed1ba4bba6c075d5ad61bb75e3fbc870840d6 upstream

The previous patch has limited swap file size so that large offsets cannot
clear bits above MAX_PA/2 in the pte and interfere with L1TF mitigation.

It assumed that offsets are encoded starting with bit 12, same as pfn. But
on x86_64, offsets are encoded starting with bit 9.

Thus the limit can be raised by 3 bits. That means 16TB with 42bit MAX_PA
and 256TB with 46bit MAX_PA.
