Subject: [PATCH] cred: allow get_cred() and put_cred() to be given NULL.

commit f06bc03339ad4c1baa964a5f0606247ac1c3c50b upstream.

It is common practice for helpers like this to silently,
accept a NULL pointer.
get_rpccred() and put_rpccred() used by NFS act this way
and using the same interface will ease the conversion
for NFS, and simplify the resulting code.
