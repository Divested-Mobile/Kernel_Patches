Subject: x86/cpufeatures: Hide AMD-specific speculation flags

Hide the AMD_{IBRS,IBPB,STIBP} flag from /proc/cpuinfo.  This was done
upstream as part of commit e7c587da1252 "x86/speculation: Use
synthetic bits for IBRS/IBPB/STIBP".  That commit has already been
backported but this part was omitted.
