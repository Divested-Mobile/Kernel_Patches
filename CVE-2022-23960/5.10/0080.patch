Subject: arm64: spectre: Rename spectre_v4_patch_fw_mitigation_conduit

commit 1b33d4860deaecf1d8eec3061b7e7ed7ab0bae8d upstream.

The spectre-v4 sequence includes an SMC from the assembly entry code.
spectre_v4_patch_fw_mitigation_conduit is the patching callback that
generates an HVC or SMC depending on the SMCCC conduit type.

As this isn't specific to spectre-v4, rename it
smccc_patch_fw_mitigation_conduit so it can be re-used.
