Subject: HID: i2c-hid-of: fix NULL-deref on failed power up

commit 00aab7dcb2267f2aef59447602f34501efe1a07f upstream.

A while back the I2C HID implementation was split in an ACPI and OF
part, but the new OF driver never initialises the client pointer which
is dereferenced on power-up failures.

Fixes: b33752c30023 ("HID: i2c-hid: Reorganize so ACPI and OF are separate modules")
