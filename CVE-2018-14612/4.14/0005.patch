Subject: btrfs: tree-checker: Detect invalid and empty essential trees

commit ba480dd4db9f1798541eb2d1c423fc95feee8d36 upstream.

A crafted image has empty root tree block, which will later cause NULL
pointer dereference.

The following trees should never be empty:
1) Tree root
   Must contain at least root items for extent tree, device tree and fs
   tree

2) Chunk tree
   Or we can't even bootstrap as it contains the mapping.

3) Fs tree
   At least inode item for top level inode (.).

4) Device tree
   Dev extents for chunks

5) Extent tree
   Must have corresponding extent for each chunk.

If any of them is empty, we are sure the fs is corrupted and no need to
mount it.
