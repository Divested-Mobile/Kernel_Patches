Subject: nfsd: auth: Fix gid sorting when rootsquash enabled

[ Upstream commit 1995266727fa8143897e89b55f5d3c79aa828420 ]

Commit bdcf0a423ea1 ("kernel: make groups_sort calling a responsibility
group_info allocators") appears to break nfsd rootsquash in a pretty
major way.

It adds a call to groups_sort() inside the loop that copies/squashes
gids, which means the valid gids are sorted along with the following
garbage.  The net result is that the highest numbered valid gids are
replaced with any lower-valued garbage gids, possibly including 0.

We should sort only once, after filling in all the gids.

Fixes: bdcf0a423ea1 ("kernel: make groups_sort calling a responsibility ...")
