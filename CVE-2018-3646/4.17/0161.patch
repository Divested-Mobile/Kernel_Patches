Subject: x86/irq: Demote irq_cpustat_t::__softirq_pending to u16

commit 9aee5f8a7e30330d0a8f4c626dc924ca5590aba5 upstream

An upcoming patch will extend KVM's L1TF mitigation in conditional mode
to also cover interrupts after VMEXITs. For tracking those, stores to a
new per-cpu flag from interrupt handlers will become necessary.

In order to improve cache locality, this new flag will be added to x86's
irq_cpustat_t.

Make some space available there by shrinking the ->softirq_pending bitfield
from 32 to 16 bits: the number of bits actually used is only NR_SOFTIRQS,
i.e. 10.
