Subject: cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS

If SMT is disabled in BIOS, the CPU code doesn't properly detect it.
The /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control file shows 'on', and the 'l1tf'
vulnerabilities file shows SMT as vulnerable.

Fix it by forcing 'cpu_smt_control' to CPU_SMT_NOT_SUPPORTED in such a
case.  Unfortunately the detection can only be done after bringing all
the CPUs online, so we have to overwrite any previous writes to the
variable.
