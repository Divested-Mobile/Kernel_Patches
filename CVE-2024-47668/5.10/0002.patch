Subject: lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()

[ Upstream commit b2f11c6f3e1fc60742673b8675c95b78447f3dae ]

If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then
race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'll
still have a preallocated node that might be used later.

If we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have a
pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it
in the cmpxchg failure path.
