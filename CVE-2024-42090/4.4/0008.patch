Subject: pinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER

[ Upstream commit adec57ff8e66aee632f3dd1f93787c13d112b7a1 ]

In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling
add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl()
calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire
pinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to
a potential deadlock.

This patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before
calling pinctrl_free(), preventing the deadlock.

This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.
