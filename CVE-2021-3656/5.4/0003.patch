Subject: KVM: nSVM: always intercept VMLOAD/VMSAVE when nested (CVE-2021-3656)

commit c7dfa4009965a9b2d7b329ee970eb8da0d32f0bc upstream.

If L1 disables VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts, and doesn't enable
Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE (currently not supported for the nested hypervisor),
then VMLOAD/VMSAVE must operate on the L1 physical memory, which is only
possible by making L0 intercept these instructions.

Failure to do so allowed the nested guest to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE unintercepted,
and thus read/write portions of the host physical memory.

Fixes: 89c8a4984fc9 ("KVM: SVM: Enable Virtual VMLOAD VMSAVE feature")
