Subject: ALSA: timer: Set lower bound of start tick time

commit 4a63bd179fa8d3fcc44a0d9d71d941ddd62f0c4e upstream.

Currently ALSA timer doesn't have the lower limit of the start tick
time, and it allows a very small size, e.g. 1 tick with 1ns resolution
for hrtimer.  Such a situation may lead to an unexpected RCU stall,
where  the callback repeatedly queuing the expire update, as reported
by fuzzer.

This patch introduces a sanity check of the timer start tick time, so
that the system returns an error when a too small start size is set.
As of this patch, the lower limit is hard-coded to 100us, which is
small enough but can still work somehow.
