Subject: Bluetooth: Fix update of connection state in `hci_encrypt_cfm`

commit 339ddaa626995bc6218972ca241471f3717cc5f4 upstream.

Starting with the upgrade to v5.8-rc3, I've noticed I wasn't able to
connect to my Bluetooth headset properly anymore. While connecting to
the device would eventually succeed, bluetoothd seemed to be confused
about the current connection state where the state was flapping hence
and forth. Bisecting this issue led to commit 3ca44c16b0dc (Bluetooth:
Consolidate encryption handling in hci_encrypt_cfm, 2020-05-19), which
refactored `hci_encrypt_cfm` to also handle updating the connection
state.

The commit in question changed the code to call `hci_connect_cfm` inside
`hci_encrypt_cfm` and to change the connection state. But with the
conversion, we now only update the connection state if a status was set
already. In fact, the reverse should be true: the status should be
updated if no status is yet set. So let's fix the isuse by reversing the
condition.
