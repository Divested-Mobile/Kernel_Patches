Subject: x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush
 synchronization

commit 71b3c126e61177eb693423f2e18a1914205b165e upstream.

When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
starting to fill the local TLB.

Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
a couple that were missing.

[bwh: Backported to 3.2:
 - There's no flush_tlb_mm_range(), only flush_tlb_mm() which does not use
   INVLPG
 - Adjust context]
