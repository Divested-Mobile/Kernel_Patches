Subject: net/sched: cls_fw: No longer copy tcf_result on update to avoid
 use-after-free

commit 76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec upstream.

When fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole
tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter.

This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class,
as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the
success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class
and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.

Fix this by no longer copying the tcf_result struct from the old filter.
