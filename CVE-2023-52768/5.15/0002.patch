Subject: wifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 05ac1a198a63ad66bf5ae8b7321407c102d40ef3 upstream.

Enabling KASAN and running some iperf tests raises some memory issues with
vmm_table:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in wilc_wlan_handle_txq+0x6ac/0xdb4
Write of size 4 at addr c3a61540 by task wlan0-tx/95

KASAN detects that we are writing data beyond range allocated to vmm_table.
There is indeed a mismatch between the size passed to allocator in
wilc_wlan_init, and the range of possible indexes used later: allocation
size is missing a multiplication by sizeof(u32)
