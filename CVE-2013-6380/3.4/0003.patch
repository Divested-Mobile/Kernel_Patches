Subject: aacraid: prevent invalid pointer dereference

commit b4789b8e6be3151a955ade74872822f30e8cd914 upstream.

It appears that driver runs into a problem here if fibsize is too small
because we allocate user_srbcmd with fibsize size only but later we
access it until user_srbcmd->sg.count to copy it over to srbcmd.

It is not correct to test (fibsize < sizeof(*user_srbcmd)) because this
structure already includes one sg element and this is not needed for
commands without data.  So, we would recommend to add the following
(instead of test for fibsize == 0).
