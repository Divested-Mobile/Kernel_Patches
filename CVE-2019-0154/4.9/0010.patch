Subject: drm/i915: Lower RM timeout to avoid DSI hard hangs

commit 1d85a299c4db57c55e0229615132c964d17aa765 upstream.

In BXT/APL, device 2 MMIO reads from MIPI controller requires its PLL
to be turned ON. When MIPI PLL is turned off (MIPI Display is not
active or connected), and someone (host or GT engine) tries to read
MIPI registers, it causes hard hang. This is a hardware restriction
or limitation.

Driver by itself doesn't read MIPI registers when MIPI display is off.
But any userspace application can submit unprivileged batch buffer for
execution. In that batch buffer there can be mmio reads. And these
reads are allowed even for unprivileged applications. If these
register reads are for MIPI DSI controller and MIPI display is not
active during that time, then the MMIO read operation causes system
hard hang and only way to recover is hard reboot. A genuine
process/application won't submit batch buffer like this and doesn't
cause any issue. But on a compromised system, a malign userspace
process/app can generate such batch buffer and can trigger system
hard hang (denial of service attack).

The fix is to lower the internal MMIO timeout value to an optimum
value of 950us as recommended by hardware team. If the timeout is
beyond 1ms (which will hit for any value we choose if MMIO READ on a
DSI specific register is performed without PLL ON), it causes the
system hang. But if the timeout value is lower than it will be below
the threshold (even if timeout happens) and system will not get into
a hung state. This will avoid a system hang without losing any
programming or GT interrupts, taking the worst case of lowest CDCLK
frequency and early DC5 abort into account.
