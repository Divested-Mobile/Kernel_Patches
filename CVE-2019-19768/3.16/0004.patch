Subject: blktrace: fix dereference after null check

commit 153031a301bb07194e9c37466cfce8eacb977621 upstream.

There was a recent change in blktrace.c that added a RCU protection to
`q->blk_trace` in order to fix a use-after-free issue during access.

However the change missed an edge case that can lead to dereferencing of
`bt` pointer even when it's NULL:

Coverity static analyzer marked this as a FORWARD_NULL issue with CID
1460458.

```
/kernel/trace/blktrace.c: 1904 in sysfs_blk_trace_attr_store()
1898            ret = 0;
1899            if (bt == NULL)
1900                    ret = blk_trace_setup_queue(q, bdev);
1901
1902            if (ret == 0) {
1903                    if (attr == &dev_attr_act_mask)
>>>     CID 1460458:  Null pointer dereferences  (FORWARD_NULL)
>>>     Dereferencing null pointer "bt".
1904                            bt->act_mask = value;
1905                    else if (attr == &dev_attr_pid)
1906                            bt->pid = value;
1907                    else if (attr == &dev_attr_start_lba)
1908                            bt->start_lba = value;
1909                    else if (attr == &dev_attr_end_lba)
```

Added a reassignment with RCU annotation to fix the issue.
