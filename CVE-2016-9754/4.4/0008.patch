Subject: ring-buffer: Prevent overflow of size in ring_buffer_resize()

commit 59643d1535eb220668692a5359de22545af579f6 upstream.

If the size passed to ring_buffer_resize() is greater than MAX_LONG - BUF_PAGE_SIZE
then the DIV_ROUND_UP() will return zero.

Here's the details:

  # echo 18014398509481980 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb

tracing_entries_write() processes this and converts kb to bytes.

 18014398509481980 << 10 = 18446744073709547520

and this is passed to ring_buffer_resize() as unsigned long size.

 size = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE);

Where DIV_ROUND_UP(a, b) is (a + b - 1)/b

BUF_PAGE_SIZE is 4080 and here

 18446744073709547520 + 4080 - 1 = 18446744073709551599

where 18446744073709551599 is still smaller than 2^64

 2^64 - 18446744073709551599 = 17

But now 18446744073709551599 / 4080 = 4521260802379792

and size = size * 4080 = 18446744073709551360

This is checked to make sure its still greater than 2 * 4080,
which it is.

Then we convert to the number of buffer pages needed.

 nr_page = DIV_ROUND_UP(size, BUF_PAGE_SIZE)

but this time size is 18446744073709551360 and

 2^64 - (18446744073709551360 + 4080 - 1) = -3823

Thus it overflows and the resulting number is less than 4080, which makes

  3823 / 4080 = 0

an nr_pages is set to this. As we already checked against the minimum that
nr_pages may be, this causes the logic to fail as well, and we crash the
kernel.

There's no reason to have the two DIV_ROUND_UP() (that's just result of
historical code changes), clean up the code and fix this bug.
