Subject: ksm: introduce ksm_max_page_sharing per page deduplication limit

Without a max deduplication limit for each KSM page, the list of the
rmap_items associated to each stable_node can grow infinitely large.

During the rmap walk each entry can take up to ~10usec to process
because of IPIs for the TLB flushing (both for the primary MMU and the
secondary MMUs with the MMU notifier).  With only 16GB of address space
shared in the same KSM page, that would amount to dozens of seconds of
kernel runtime.

A ~256 max deduplication factor will reduce the latencies of the rmap
walks on KSM pages to order of a few msec.  Just doing the
cond_resched() during the rmap walks is not enough, the list size must
have a limit too, otherwise the caller could get blocked in (schedule
friendly) kernel computations for seconds, unexpectedly.

There's room for optimization to significantly reduce the IPI delivery
cost during the page_referenced(), but at least for page_migration in
the KSM case (used by hard NUMA bindings, compaction and NUMA balancing)
it may be inevitable to send lots of IPIs if each rmap_item->mm is
active on a different CPU and there are lots of CPUs.  Even if we ignore
the IPI delivery cost, we've still to walk the whole KSM rmap list, so
we can't allow millions or billions (ulimited) number of entries in the
KSM stable_node rmap_item lists.

The limit is enforced efficiently by adding a second dimension to the
stable rbtree.  So there are three types of stable_nodes: the regular
ones (identical as before, living in the first flat dimension of the
stable rbtree), the "chains" and the "dups".

Every "chain" and all "dups" linked into a "chain" enforce the invariant
that they represent the same write protected memory content, even if
each "dup" will be pointed by a different KSM page copy of that content.
This way the stable rbtree lookup computational complexity is unaffected
if compared to an unlimited max_sharing_limit.  It is still enforced
that there cannot be KSM page content duplicates in the stable rbtree
itself.

Adding the second dimension to the stable rbtree only after the
max_page_sharing limit hits, provides for a zero memory footprint
increase on 64bit archs.  The memory overhead of the per-KSM page
stable_tree and per virtual mapping rmap_item is unchanged.  Only after
the max_page_sharing limit hits, we need to allocate a stable_tree
"chain" and rb_replace() the "regular" stable_node with the newly
allocated stable_node "chain".  After that we simply add the "regular"
stable_node to the chain as a stable_node "dup" by linking hlist_dup in
the stable_node_chain->hlist.  This way the "regular" (flat) stable_node
is converted to a stable_node "dup" living in the second dimension of
the stable rbtree.

During stable rbtree lookups the stable_node "chain" is identified as
stable_node->rmap_hlist_len == STABLE_NODE_CHAIN (aka
is_stable_node_chain()).

When dropping stable_nodes, the stable_node "dup" is identified as
stable_node->head == STABLE_NODE_DUP_HEAD (aka is_stable_node_dup()).

The STABLE_NODE_DUP_HEAD must be an unique valid pointer never used
elsewhere in any stable_node->head/node to avoid a clashes with the
stable_node->node.rb_parent_color pointer, and different from
&migrate_nodes.  So the second field of &migrate_nodes is picked and
verified as always safe with a BUILD_BUG_ON in case the list_head
implementation changes in the future.

The STABLE_NODE_DUP is picked as a random negative value in
stable_node->rmap_hlist_len.  rmap_hlist_len cannot become negative when
it's a "regular" stable_node or a stable_node "dup".

The stable_node_chain->nid is irrelevant.  The stable_node_chain->kpfn
is aliased in a union with a time field used to rate limit the
stable_node_chain->hlist prunes.

The garbage collection of the stable_node_chain happens lazily during
stable rbtree lookups (as for all other kind of stable_nodes), or while
disabling KSM with "echo 2 >/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run" while collecting the
entire stable rbtree.

While the "regular" stable_nodes and the stable_node "dups" must wait
for their underlying tree_page to be freed before they can be freed
themselves, the stable_node "chains" can be freed immediately if the
stable_node->hlist turns empty.  This is because the "chains" are never
pointed by any page->mapping and they're effectively stable rbtree KSM
self contained metadata.

+                   (i.e. virtual mappings) that are sharing the page,
+                   which is in turn capped by max_page_sharing. So

+                   will be fewer stable_node dups queued into the
+                   stable_node chain->hlist to check for pruning) and
+                   the higher the deduplication factor will be, but
+                   the slowest the worst case rmap walk could be for
+                   any given KSM page. Slowing down the rmap_walk
