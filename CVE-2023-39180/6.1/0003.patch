Subject: ksmbd: no response from compound read

[ Upstream commit e202a1e8634b186da38cbbff85382ea2b9e297cf ]

ksmbd doesn't support compound read. If client send read-read in
compound to ksmbd, there can be memory leak from read buffer.
Windows and linux clients doesn't send it to server yet. For now,
No response from compound read. compound read will be supported soon.
