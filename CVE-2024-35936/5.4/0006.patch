Subject: btrfs: handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks()

[ Upstream commit 7411055db5ce64f836aaffd422396af0075fdc99 ]

The unhandled case in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption,
as it could be caused only by two impossible conditions:

- at first the search key is set up to look for a chunk tree item, with
  offset -1, this is an inexact search and the key->offset will contain
  the correct offset upon a successful search, a valid chunk tree item
  cannot have an offset -1

- after first successful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk
  item, the offset is decremented by 1 before the next loop, it's
  impossible to find a chunk item there due to alignment and size
  constraints
