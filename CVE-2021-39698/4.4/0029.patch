Subject: wait: add wake_up_pollfree()

commit 42288cb44c4b5fff7653bc392b583a2b8bd6a8c0 upstream.

Several ->poll() implementations are special in that they use a
waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
before it is freed, using 'wake_up_poll(wq, EPOLLHUP | POLLFREE);'.

However, that has a bug: wake_up_poll() calls __wake_up() with
nr_exclusive=1.  Therefore, if there are multiple "exclusive" waiters,
and the wakeup function for the first one returns a positive value, only
that one will be called.  That's *not* what's needed for POLLFREE;
POLLFREE is special in that it really needs to wake up everyone.

Considering the three non-blocking poll systems:

- io_uring poll doesn't handle POLLFREE at all, so it is broken anyway.

- aio poll is unaffected, since it doesn't support exclusive waits.
  However, that's fragile, as someone could add this feature later.

- epoll doesn't appear to be broken by this, since its wakeup function
  returns 0 when it sees POLLFREE.  But this is fragile.

Although there is a workaround (see epoll), it's better to define a
function which always sends POLLFREE to all waiters.  Add such a
function.  Also make it verify that the queue really becomes empty after
all waiters have been woken up.
