+File system Monitoring with fanotify
+====================================
+
+File system Error Reporting
+===========================
+
+Fanotify supports the FAN_FS_ERROR event type for file system-wide error
+reporting.  It is meant to be used by file system health monitoring
+daemons, which listen for these events and take actions (notify
+sysadmin, start recovery) when a file system problem is detected.
+
+By design, a FAN_FS_ERROR notification exposes sufficient information
+for a monitoring tool to know a problem in the file system has happened.
+It doesn't necessarily provide a user space application with semantics
+to verify an IO operation was successfully executed.  That is out of
+scope for this feature.  Instead, it is only meant as a framework for
+early file system problem detection and reporting recovery tools.
+
+When a file system operation fails, it is common for dozens of kernel
+errors to cascade after the initial failure, hiding the original failure
+log, which is usually the most useful debug data to troubleshoot the
+problem.  For this reason, FAN_FS_ERROR tries to report only the first
+error that occurred for a file system since the last notification, and
+it simply counts additional errors.  This ensures that the most
+important pieces of information are never lost.
+
+FAN_FS_ERROR requires the fanotify group to be setup with the
+FAN_REPORT_FID flag.
+
+At the time of this writing, the only file system that emits FAN_FS_ERROR
+notifications is Ext4.
+
+A FAN_FS_ERROR Notification has the following format::
+
+  [ Notification Metadata (Mandatory) ]
+  [ Generic Error Record  (Mandatory) ]
+  [ FID record            (Mandatory) ]
+
+The order of records is not guaranteed, and new records might be added
+in the future.  Therefore, applications must not rely on the order and
+must be prepared to skip over unknown records. Please refer to
+``samples/fanotify/fs-monitor.c`` for an example parser.
+
+Generic error record
+--------------------
+
+The generic error record provides enough information for a file system
+agnostic tool to learn about a problem in the file system, without
+providing any additional details about the problem.  This record is
+identified by ``struct fanotify_event_info_header.info_type`` being set
+to FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_ERROR.
+
+  struct fanotify_event_info_error {
+	struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
+	__s32 error;
+	__u32 error_count;
+  };
+
+The `error` field identifies the type of error using errno values.
+`error_count` tracks the number of errors that occurred and were
+suppressed to preserve the original error information, since the last
+notification.
+
+FID record
+----------
+
+The FID record can be used to uniquely identify the inode that triggered
+the error through the combination of fsid and file handle.  A file system
+specific application can use that information to attempt a recovery
+procedure.  Errors that are not related to an inode are reported with an
+empty file handle of type FILEID_INVALID.

+==================================
+Register File Data Sampling (RFDS)
+==================================
+
+Register File Data Sampling (RFDS) is a microarchitectural vulnerability that
+only affects Intel Atom parts(also branded as E-cores). RFDS may allow
+a malicious actor to infer data values previously used in floating point
+registers, vector registers, or integer registers. RFDS does not provide the
+ability to choose which data is inferred. CVE-2023-28746 is assigned to RFDS.
+
+Affected Processors
+===================
+Below is the list of affected Intel processors [#f1]_:
+
+   ===================  ============
+   Common name          Family_Model
+   ===================  ============
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT           06_5CH
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT_D         06_5FH
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT_PLUS      06_7AH
+   ATOM_TREMONT_D          06_86H
+   ATOM_TREMONT            06_96H
+   ALDERLAKE               06_97H
+   ALDERLAKE_L             06_9AH
+   ATOM_TREMONT_L          06_9CH
+   RAPTORLAKE              06_B7H
+   RAPTORLAKE_P            06_BAH
+   ALDERLAKE_N             06_BEH
+   RAPTORLAKE_S            06_BFH
+   ===================  ============
+
+As an exception to this table, Intel Xeon E family parts ALDERLAKE(06_97H) and
+RAPTORLAKE(06_B7H) codenamed Catlow are not affected. They are reported as
+vulnerable in Linux because they share the same family/model with an affected
+part. Unlike their affected counterparts, they do not enumerate RFDS_CLEAR or
+CPUID.HYBRID. This information could be used to distinguish between the
+affected and unaffected parts, but it is deemed not worth adding complexity as
+the reporting is fixed automatically when these parts enumerate RFDS_NO.
+
+Mitigation
+==========
+Intel released a microcode update that enables software to clear sensitive
+information using the VERW instruction. Like MDS, RFDS deploys the same
+mitigation strategy to force the CPU to clear the affected buffers before an
+attacker can extract the secrets. This is achieved by using the otherwise
+unused and obsolete VERW instruction in combination with a microcode update.
+The microcode clears the affected CPU buffers when the VERW instruction is
+executed.
+
+Mitigation points
+-----------------
+VERW is executed by the kernel before returning to user space, and by KVM
+before VMentry. None of the affected cores support SMT, so VERW is not required
+at C-state transitions.
+
+New bits in IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES
+----------------------------------
+Newer processors and microcode update on existing affected processors added new
+bits to IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR. These bits can be used to enumerate
+vulnerability and mitigation capability:
+
+- Bit 27 - RFDS_NO - When set, processor is not affected by RFDS.
+- Bit 28 - RFDS_CLEAR - When set, processor is affected by RFDS, and has the
+  microcode that clears the affected buffers on VERW execution.
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+---------------------------------------------
+The kernel command line allows to control RFDS mitigation at boot time with the
+parameter "reg_file_data_sampling=". The valid arguments are:
+
+  ==========  =================================================================
+  on          If the CPU is vulnerable, enable mitigation; CPU buffer clearing
+              on exit to userspace and before entering a VM.
+  off         Disables mitigation.
+  ==========  =================================================================
+
+Mitigation default is selected by CONFIG_MITIGATION_RFDS.
+
+Mitigation status information
+-----------------------------
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current
+vulnerability status of the system: whether the system is vulnerable, and
+which mitigations are active. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+	/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/reg_file_data_sampling
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - 'Not affected'
+       - The processor is not vulnerable
+     * - 'Vulnerable'
+       - The processor is vulnerable, but no mitigation enabled
+     * - 'Vulnerable: No microcode'
+       - The processor is vulnerable but microcode is not updated.
+     * - 'Mitigation: Clear Register File'
+       - The processor is vulnerable and the CPU buffer clearing mitigation is
+	 enabled.

+   has cleared the buffers. This case is not handled and NMI returning to
+   kernel don't clear CPU buffers because:
+
+   1. It is rare to get an NMI after VERW, but before returning to userspace.
+   2. For an unprivileged user, there is no known way to make that NMI
+      less rare or target it.
+   3. It would take a large number of these precisely-timed NMIs to mount
+      an actual attack.  There's presumably not enough bandwidth.
+   4. The NMI in question occurs after a VERW, i.e. when user state is
+      restored and most interesting data is already scrubbed. Whats left
+      is only the data that NMI touches, and that may or may not be of
+      any interest.

+ *   - a user credential
+ *   - a network namespace
+ *   - a read-ahead context
+ *   - monitoring for writeback errors

+ * the acquired object, and hence the object's reference count, via
+ * nfsd_file_get and nfsd_file_put. There are two varieties of nfsd_file
+ * object:
+ *
+ *  * non-garbage-collected: When a consumer wants to precisely control
+ *    the lifetime of a file's open state, it acquires a non-garbage-
+ *    collected nfsd_file. The final nfsd_file_put releases the open
+ *    state immediately.
+ *
+ *  * garbage-collected: When a consumer does not control the lifetime
+ *    of open state, it acquires a garbage-collected nfsd_file. The
+ *    final nfsd_file_put allows the open state to linger for a period
