+==================================
+Register File Data Sampling (RFDS)
+==================================
+
+Register File Data Sampling (RFDS) is a microarchitectural vulnerability that
+only affects Intel Atom parts(also branded as E-cores). RFDS may allow
+a malicious actor to infer data values previously used in floating point
+registers, vector registers, or integer registers. RFDS does not provide the
+ability to choose which data is inferred. CVE-2023-28746 is assigned to RFDS.
+
+Affected Processors
+===================
+Below is the list of affected Intel processors [#f1]_:
+
+   ===================  ============
+   Common name          Family_Model
+   ===================  ============
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT           06_5CH
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT_D         06_5FH
+   ATOM_GOLDMONT_PLUS      06_7AH
+   ATOM_TREMONT_D          06_86H
+   ATOM_TREMONT            06_96H
+   ALDERLAKE               06_97H
+   ALDERLAKE_L             06_9AH
+   ATOM_TREMONT_L          06_9CH
+   RAPTORLAKE              06_B7H
+   RAPTORLAKE_P            06_BAH
+   ALDERLAKE_N             06_BEH
+   RAPTORLAKE_S            06_BFH
+   ===================  ============
+
+As an exception to this table, Intel Xeon E family parts ALDERLAKE(06_97H) and
+RAPTORLAKE(06_B7H) codenamed Catlow are not affected. They are reported as
+vulnerable in Linux because they share the same family/model with an affected
+part. Unlike their affected counterparts, they do not enumerate RFDS_CLEAR or
+CPUID.HYBRID. This information could be used to distinguish between the
+affected and unaffected parts, but it is deemed not worth adding complexity as
+the reporting is fixed automatically when these parts enumerate RFDS_NO.
+
+Mitigation
+==========
+Intel released a microcode update that enables software to clear sensitive
+information using the VERW instruction. Like MDS, RFDS deploys the same
+mitigation strategy to force the CPU to clear the affected buffers before an
+attacker can extract the secrets. This is achieved by using the otherwise
+unused and obsolete VERW instruction in combination with a microcode update.
+The microcode clears the affected CPU buffers when the VERW instruction is
+executed.
+
+Mitigation points
+-----------------
+VERW is executed by the kernel before returning to user space, and by KVM
+before VMentry. None of the affected cores support SMT, so VERW is not required
+at C-state transitions.
+
+New bits in IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES
+----------------------------------
+Newer processors and microcode update on existing affected processors added new
+bits to IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR. These bits can be used to enumerate
+vulnerability and mitigation capability:
+
+- Bit 27 - RFDS_NO - When set, processor is not affected by RFDS.
+- Bit 28 - RFDS_CLEAR - When set, processor is affected by RFDS, and has the
+  microcode that clears the affected buffers on VERW execution.
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+---------------------------------------------
+The kernel command line allows to control RFDS mitigation at boot time with the
+parameter "reg_file_data_sampling=". The valid arguments are:
+
+  ==========  =================================================================
+  on          If the CPU is vulnerable, enable mitigation; CPU buffer clearing
+              on exit to userspace and before entering a VM.
+  off         Disables mitigation.
+  ==========  =================================================================
+
+Mitigation default is selected by CONFIG_MITIGATION_RFDS.
+
+Mitigation status information
+-----------------------------
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current
+vulnerability status of the system: whether the system is vulnerable, and
+which mitigations are active. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+	/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/reg_file_data_sampling
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - 'Not affected'
+       - The processor is not vulnerable
+     * - 'Vulnerable'
+       - The processor is vulnerable, but no mitigation enabled
+     * - 'Vulnerable: No microcode'
+       - The processor is vulnerable but microcode is not updated.
+     * - 'Mitigation: Clear Register File'
+       - The processor is vulnerable and the CPU buffer clearing mitigation is
+	 enabled.

+   kernel don't clear CPU buffers because:
+
+   1. It is rare to get an NMI after VERW, but before returning to userspace.
+   2. For an unprivileged user, there is no known way to make that NMI
+      less rare or target it.
+   3. It would take a large number of these precisely-timed NMIs to mount
+      an actual attack.  There's presumably not enough bandwidth.
+   4. The NMI in question occurs after a VERW, i.e. when user state is
+      restored and most interesting data is already scrubbed. Whats left
+      is only the data that NMI touches, and that may or may not be of
+      any interest.

  * Stack protector works by putting predefined pattern at the start of
  * the stack frame and verifying that it hasn't been overwritten when
  * returning from the function.  The pattern is called stack canary
- * and unfortunately gcc requires it to be at a fixed offset from %gs.
- * On x86_64, the offset is 40 bytes and on x86_32 20 bytes.  x86_64
- * and x86_32 use segment registers differently and thus handles this
- * requirement differently.
+ * and unfortunately gcc historically required it to be at a fixed offset
+ * from the percpu segment base.  On x86_64, the offset is 40 bytes.
  *
- * On x86_64, %gs is shared by percpu area and stack canary.  All
- * percpu symbols are zero based and %gs points to the base of percpu
- * area.  The first occupant of the percpu area is always
- * fixed_percpu_data which contains stack_canary at offset 40.  Userland
- * %gs is always saved and restored on kernel entry and exit using
- * swapgs, so stack protector doesn't add any complexity there.
+ * The same segment is shared by percpu area and stack canary.  On
+ * x86_64, percpu symbols are zero based and %gs (64-bit) points to the
+ * base of percpu area.  The first occupant of the percpu area is always
+ * fixed_percpu_data which contains stack_canary at the approproate
+ * offset.  On x86_32, the stack canary is just a regular percpu
+ * variable.
  *
- * On x86_32, it's slightly more complicated.  As in x86_64, %gs is
- * used for userland TLS.  Unfortunately, some processors are much
- * slower at loading segment registers with different value when
- * entering and leaving the kernel, so the kernel uses %fs for percpu
- * area and manages %gs lazily so that %gs is switched only when
- * necessary, usually during task switch.
+ * Putting percpu data in %fs on 32-bit is a minor optimization compared to
+ * using %gs.  Since 32-bit userspace normally has %fs == 0, we are likely
+ * to load 0 into %fs on exit to usermode, whereas with percpu data in
+ * %gs, we are likely to load a non-null %gs on return to user mode.
  *
- * As gcc requires the stack canary at %gs:20, %gs can't be managed
- * lazily if stack protector is enabled, so the kernel saves and
- * restores userland %gs on kernel entry and exit.  This behavior is
- * controlled by CONFIG_X86_32_LAZY_GS and accessors are defined in
- * system.h to hide the details.
+ * Once we are willing to require GCC 8.1 or better for 64-bit stackprotector
+ * support, we can remove some of this complexity.
