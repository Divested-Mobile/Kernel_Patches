+ * changed inlining behavior and caused compilation failure as some branch
+ * target distance exceeded 16bit representation which is the maximum for
+ * cpu v1/v2/v3. Macro __BPF_CPU_VERSION__ is later implemented in clang18
+ * to specify which cpu version is used for compilation. So a smaller
+ * unroll_count can be set if __BPF_CPU_VERSION__ is less than 4, which
+ * reduced some branch target distances and resolved the compilation failure.
+ *
+ * To capture the case where a developer/ci uses clang18 but the corresponding
+ * repo checkpoint does not have __BPF_CPU_VERSION__, a smaller unroll_count
+ * will be set as well to prevent potential compilation failures.
