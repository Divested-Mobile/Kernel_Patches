+ * CPU capabilities:
+ *
+ * We use arm64_cpu_capabilities to represent system features, errata work
+ * arounds (both used internally by kernel and tracked in cpu_hwcaps) and
+ * ELF HWCAPs (which are exposed to user).
+ *
+ * To support systems with heterogeneous CPUs, we need to make sure that we
+ * detect the capabilities correctly on the system and take appropriate
+ * measures to ensure there are no incompatibilities.
+ *
+ * This comment tries to explain how we treat the capabilities.
+ * Each capability has the following list of attributes :
+ *
+ * 1) Scope of Detection : The system detects a given capability by
+ *    performing some checks at runtime. This could be, e.g, checking the
+ *    value of a field in CPU ID feature register or checking the cpu
+ *    model. The capability provides a call back ( @matches() ) to
+ *    perform the check. Scope defines how the checks should be performed.
+ *    There are two cases:
+ *
+ *     a) SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU: check all the CPUs and "detect" if at least one
+ *        matches. This implies, we have to run the check on all the
+ *        booting CPUs, until the system decides that state of the
+ *        capability is finalised. (See section 2 below)
+ *		Or
+ *     b) SCOPE_SYSTEM: check all the CPUs and "detect" if all the CPUs
+ *        matches. This implies, we run the check only once, when the
+ *        system decides to finalise the state of the capability. If the
+ *        capability relies on a field in one of the CPU ID feature
+ *        registers, we use the sanitised value of the register from the
+ *        CPU feature infrastructure to make the decision.
+ *
+ *    The process of detection is usually denoted by "update" capability
+ *    state in the code.
+ *
+ * 2) Finalise the state : The kernel should finalise the state of a
+ *    capability at some point during its execution and take necessary
+ *    actions if any. Usually, this is done, after all the boot-time
+ *    enabled CPUs are brought up by the kernel, so that it can make
+ *    better decision based on the available set of CPUs. However, there
+ *    are some special cases, where the action is taken during the early
+ *    boot by the primary boot CPU. (e.g, running the kernel at EL2 with
+ *    Virtualisation Host Extensions). The kernel usually disallows any
+ *    changes to the state of a capability once it finalises the capability
+ *    and takes any action, as it may be impossible to execute the actions
+ *    safely. A CPU brought up after a capability is "finalised" is
+ *    referred to as "Late CPU" w.r.t the capability. e.g, all secondary
+ *    CPUs are treated "late CPUs" for capabilities determined by the boot
+ *    CPU.
+ *
+ * 3) Verification: When a CPU is brought online (e.g, by user or by the
+ *    kernel), the kernel should make sure that it is safe to use the CPU,
+ *    by verifying that the CPU is compliant with the state of the
+ *    capabilities finalised already. This happens via :
+ *
+ *	secondary_start_kernel()-> check_local_cpu_capabilities()
+ *
+ *    As explained in (2) above, capabilities could be finalised at
+ *    different points in the execution. Each CPU is verified against the
+ *    "finalised" capabilities and if there is a conflict, the kernel takes
+ *    an action, based on the severity (e.g, a CPU could be prevented from
+ *    booting or cause a kernel panic). The CPU is allowed to "affect" the
+ *    state of the capability, if it has not been finalised already.
+ *    See section 5 for more details on conflicts.
+ *
+ * 4) Action: As mentioned in (2), the kernel can take an action for each
+ *    detected capability, on all CPUs on the system. Appropriate actions
+ *    include, turning on an architectural feature, modifying the control
+ *    registers (e.g, SCTLR, TCR etc.) or patching the kernel via
+ *    alternatives. The kernel patching is batched and performed at later
+ *    point. The actions are always initiated only after the capability
+ *    is finalised. This is usally denoted by "enabling" the capability.
+ *    The actions are initiated as follows :
+ *	a) Action is triggered on all online CPUs, after the capability is
+ *	finalised, invoked within the stop_machine() context from
+ *	enable_cpu_capabilitie().
+ *
+ *	b) Any late CPU, brought up after (1), the action is triggered via:
+ *
+ *	  check_local_cpu_capabilities() -> verify_local_cpu_capabilities()
+ *
+ * 5) Conflicts: Based on the state of the capability on a late CPU vs.
+ *    the system state, we could have the following combinations :
+ *
+ *		x-----------------------------x
+ *		| Type  | System   | Late CPU |
+ *		|-----------------------------|
+ *		|  a    |   y      |    n     |
+ *		|-----------------------------|
+ *		|  b    |   n      |    y     |
+ *		x-----------------------------x
+ *
+ *     Two separate flag bits are defined to indicate whether each kind of
+ *     conflict can be allowed:
+ *		ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU - Case(a) is allowed
+ *		ARM64_CPUCAP_PERMITTED_FOR_LATE_CPU - Case(b) is allowed
+ *
+ *     Case (a) is not permitted for a capability that the system requires
+ *     all CPUs to have in order for the capability to be enabled. This is
+ *     typical for capabilities that represent enhanced functionality.
+ *
+ *     Case (b) is not permitted for a capability that must be enabled
+ *     during boot if any CPU in the system requires it in order to run
+ *     safely. This is typical for erratum work arounds that cannot be
+ *     enabled after the corresponding capability is finalised.
+ *
+ *     In some non-typical cases either both (a) and (b), or neither,
+ *     should be permitted. This can be described by including neither
+ *     or both flags in the capability's type field.
