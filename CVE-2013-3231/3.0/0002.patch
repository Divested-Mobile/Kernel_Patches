Subject: llc: Fix missing msg_namelen update in llc_ui_recvmsg()

[ Upstream commit c77a4b9cffb6215a15196ec499490d116dfad181 ]

For stream sockets the code misses to update the msg_namelen member
to 0 and therefore makes net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized
sockaddr_storage variable to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack
memory. The msg_namelen update is also missing for datagram sockets
in case the socket is shutting down during receive.

Fix both issues by setting msg_namelen to 0 early. It will be
updated later if we're going to fill the msg_name member.
