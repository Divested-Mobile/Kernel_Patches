Subject: i2c: xgene-slimpro: Fix out-of-bounds bug in xgene_slimpro_i2c_xfer()

commit 92fbb6d1296f81f41f65effd7f5f8c0f74943d15 upstream.

The data->block[0] variable comes from user and is a number between
0-255. Without proper check, the variable may be very large to cause
an out-of-bounds when performing memcpy in slimpro_i2c_blkwr.

Fix this bug by checking the value of writelen.
