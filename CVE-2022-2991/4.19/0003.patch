Subject: lightnvm: disable the subsystem
MIME-Version: 1.0

In commit 9ea9b9c48387 ("remove the lightnvm subsystem") the lightnvm
subsystem was removed as there is no hardware in the wild for it, and
the code is known to have problems.  This should also be disabled for
older LTS kernels as well to prevent anyone from accidentally using it.
