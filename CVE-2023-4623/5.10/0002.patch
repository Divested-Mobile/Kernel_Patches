Subject: net/sched: sch_hfsc: Ensure inner classes have fsc curve

[ Upstream commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f ]

HFSC assumes that inner classes have an fsc curve, but it is currently
possible for classes without an fsc curve to become parents. This leads
to bugs including a use-after-free.

Don't allow non-root classes without HFSC_FSC to become parents.
