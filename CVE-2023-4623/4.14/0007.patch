Subject: net/sched: sch_hfsc: Ensure inner classes have fsc curve

commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f upstream.

HFSC assumes that inner classes have an fsc curve, but it is currently
possible for classes without an fsc curve to become parents. This leads
to bugs including a use-after-free.

Don't allow non-root classes without HFSC_FSC to become parents.
