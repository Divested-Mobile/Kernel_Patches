Subject: sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp

[ Upstream commit 6d2f8909a5fabb73fe2a63918117943986c39b6c ]

Util-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp values
for performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currently
computed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-one
error in some configurations.

For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A
task with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly,
correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of bound
memory access.

Clamp the bucket id to fix the issue.
