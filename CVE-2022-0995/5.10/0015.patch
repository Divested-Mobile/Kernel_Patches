Subject: watch_queue: Fix lack of barrier/sync/lock between post and read

commit 2ed147f015af2b48f41c6f0b6746aa9ea85c19f3 upstream.

There's nothing to synchronise post_one_notification() versus
pipe_read().  Whilst posting is done under pipe->rd_wait.lock, the
reader only takes pipe->mutex which cannot bar notification posting as
that may need to be made from contexts that cannot sleep.

Fix this by setting pipe->head with a barrier in post_one_notification()
and reading pipe->head with a barrier in pipe_read().

If that's not sufficient, the rd_wait.lock will need to be taken,
possibly in a ->confirm() op so that it only applies to notifications.
The lock would, however, have to be dropped before copy_page_to_iter()
is invoked.

Fixes: c73be61cede5 ("pipe: Add general notification queue support")
