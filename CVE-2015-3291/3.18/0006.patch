Subject: x86/nmi/64: Use DF to avoid userspace RSP confusing nested NMI
 detection

[ Upstream commit 810bc075f78ff2c221536eb3008eac6a492dba2d ]

We have a tricky bug in the nested NMI code: if we see RSP
pointing to the NMI stack on NMI entry from kernel mode, we
assume that we are executing a nested NMI.

This isn't quite true.  A malicious userspace program can point
RSP at the NMI stack, issue SYSCALL, and arrange for an NMI to
happen while RSP is still pointing at the NMI stack.

Fix it with a sneaky trick.  Set DF in the region of code that
the RSP check is intended to detect.  IRET will clear DF
atomically.

( Note: other than paravirt, there's little need for all this
  complexity. We could check RIP instead of RSP. )
