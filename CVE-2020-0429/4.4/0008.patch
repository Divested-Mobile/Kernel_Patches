Subject: l2tp: ensure sessions are freed after their PPPOL2TP socket

commit cdd10c9627496ad25c87ce6394e29752253c69d3 upstream.

If l2tp_tunnel_delete() or l2tp_tunnel_closeall() deletes a session
right after pppol2tp_release() orphaned its socket, then the 'sock'
variable of the pppol2tp_session_close() callback is NULL. Yet the
session is still used by pppol2tp_release().

Therefore we need to take an extra reference in any case, to prevent
l2tp_tunnel_delete() or l2tp_tunnel_closeall() from freeing the session.

Since the pppol2tp_session_close() callback is only set if the session
is associated to a PPPOL2TP socket and that both l2tp_tunnel_delete()
and l2tp_tunnel_closeall() hold the PPPOL2TP socket before calling
pppol2tp_session_close(), we're sure that pppol2tp_session_close() and
pppol2tp_session_destruct() are paired and called in the right order.
So the reference taken by the former will be released by the later.
